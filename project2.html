			<h1>Project Background</h1>
			<p>
				This project started when one of my clients of Midday Studios had gifted me 2 Infinity Reference 1252w subwoofers and a Sony Xplod 1000W XM-1652Z amp that had been unused for almost 20 years. At the time, I did not have the money nor the time to install them. About 6 months later, one of my door speakers had blown out. I started planning this project, but never got around to it. An entire year passed until I was finally able to start the project.
			</p>
			<h1>Objective(s)</h1>
			<p>
				The objective of this project was to completely revamp the sound system in my 2010 Altima Coupe, leaving nothing stock. The secondary objective was to fit the 2 subwoofers in my car without compromising my trunk space.
			</p>
			<h1>Process</h1>
			<p>
				The first step was making potential designs. The new component speakers for the doors were a direct swap, but the subwoofers needed enclosures that fit in the car, as well as an amp mounting location. I spent a lot of time drawing out different designs to utilize trunk space without too much compromise, but the subwoofers were just too big and required too much volume in their enclosures, so I had an odd idea. I looked at my back seats, and since I drive a coupe, I realized that I don't often have passengers back there, so I decided to get rid of them. I made some very rudenmentary measurements just to determine whether or not I could comfortably for all of the equipment where the back seats were, and it was looking very promising. I then stripped down the interior of my car &#40;at one point, the only thing remaining inside the car was the driver's seat, steering wheel, and some carpet&#41;, and began measuring. I had plenty of space, so I used the old cardboard mockup method to test my enclosure designs, as they did not have to be perfect. I also had to design a "floorboard" so that there was a flat and level surface where the back seats were for all the equipment to mount to. Before I began officially building my designs, I sourced all of the electronics and wiring needed for the system. This was probably my favorite part. I spent a lot of time reading wiring diagrams and drawing out new ones, as this is an extremely important part of the process. The entire system needed brand new, custom wiring, as I was installing an amp for not only the subwoofers, but a second one solely for the component speakers up front. I had installed a head unit with RCA outputs a couple years prior, so that wiring task was already complete. The audio wiring is simple, run RCA cables from the head unit to the amp(s), and then run your speaker wire (preferably oxygen free copper) from your amps to your speakers. Since I used component speakers, the speaker wire went to a crossover, which separates the higher frequencies to send to the tweeters. The worst part was running new wiring from the cabin into the doors, I don't even want to talk about it. Now, the power wiring is what you need to pay close attention to, as custom sound systems often draw a lot of power, directly from your car's battery. The process is not as simple as connecting each end to a device, as wiring using for power naturally generates heat. The more power drawn, the more heat potentially produced, and this has to be under control, or you can risk issues as bad as fires in your car. In order to do so, you have to utilize fuses throughout your power wiring so that if your system starts drawing too much energy than you wnat, the fuse with cut power. The most important fuse goes on the main power wire, and should be mounted within 12 inches of the beginning of the power wire. Fuses come in different amperages. In order to determine which amperage you need, you would take the total wattage of your system, and divide that by the voltage, which would be 12v for the average car battery. Since my 2 amps add up to 1400W, the amperage of my main fuse would be 1400 / 12 = 116.67 Amps. Now, you also have to account for power surges or sudden spikes in the system. To account for that, most people will add around a 25% buffer, so 116.67 x 1.25 = 145.8 Amps. Now that I have my final number, I bought a fuse closest to it, being 150 Amps. Now the main power to my system is safe. Since I have 2 Amps, I also had to install a distribution block, which takes the power from my main power wire and splits it into 2, 1 for each amp. The distrobution block has a fuse for each split, so that the individual amps do not draw too much energy. The manufacturer will often specifiy the amperage of fuse recommended for their amp, and many amps will also have secondary fuses on them for extra safety. Since the main power wire is always connected to the battery, we require what is a called a remote wire. The remote wire is another, much smaller, 12v power wire that is used to control when electronics in the car are drawing power. It sends signal to electronics in the car when the car powers on, telling all of the devices to turn on as well. Without the remote wire, the amps can potentially draw power constantly, even when the car isn't on, which in turn will drain the battery. Now that the wiring was set, it was time to finish building the enclosures and floorboard. I used MDF for construction, as it is a very dense material, which helps prevent cabinet vibrations and resonances. Once everything was built, I fit them into the car, made some custom mmounts to keep it in place, and then finalized everything with some carpeting. The final step was tuning the system, which can be a very delicate process. To put it simply, it requires playing different frequencies through the system and adjusting the gain settings on the amps to make sure everything is working and sounds as it is supposed to. The funny thing about it is that it requires you to turn the volume up, a lot, and sitting in a car listening to higher frequencies is... very painful, to say the least.
			</p>
			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>
				This was truly such an amazing project to work on and I loved every second of it, even the time I spent trying to run wiring into my doors. I learned so much that I had not ever bothered to look into, and all of it was incredibly interesting. I'm not sure how long this project actually took, as I worked on it on and off for a couple months, but I want to say I had spent at least 80 hours on this project, and I would absolutely do it again.
