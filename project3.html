			<h1>Project Background</h1>
			<p>
				This was a personal project involving my 2010 Altime Coupe "build". Ever since I bought the car I knew that I wanted to work on the suspension, and the excuse to do so came about when I needed new tires. Since I needed new tires, I decided now was the time to get new wheels, as I would need to adjust my tire size. Since I was buying wheels and tires, I figured that it would be the perfect time to install coilovers.
			</p>
			<h1>Objective(s)</h1>
			<p>
				The main objective of this project was to lower my car, a reasonable amount, and improve general handling of the car. The side objectives were to learn more about suspension and how to physically work on it.
			</p>
			<h1>Process</h1>
			<p>
				The first step of the process was research. I needed to know what type of suspension the car had from the factory in order to begin comparing it to what the aftermarket offered for my specific vehicle. The stock suspension was very simple, the front were standard struts, and the rear were a divorced shock and spring setup. I had a few options to weigh for my new setup: lowering springs, coilovers, or air suspension. For lowering springs: the pros were that they are very affordable, and they accomplish my objectives, but the cons come in the form of shock longevity, as lowering springs are shorter than stock, potentially causing your shocks to bottom out more frequently, which can result in damage to your seals. For air suspension: the pros were that they accomplish my objectives, as well as having easily accessible adjustability and range, but the cons are a very high price tag and complexity. For coilovers: the pros were that they accomplish my objectives and offer much better durability and customization as compared to lowering springs, but the cons are that they are more costly than lowering springs. The obvious choice for me was coilovers, and I went with the BC Racing D-28-BR set, which is a direct swap on my vehicle, including the divorced shock and spring setup in the rear. The actual process of installing the coilovers was very simple. The front included 2 bolts where the strut attaches to the knuckle and bushing, 1 bolt for the sway bar likage, and 3 bolts on the strut tower. The rear included 1 bolt for the knuckle and bushing attachment point, and 2 bolts on the strut tower, and then the separate spring sits in the stock location on the lower control arm. That was it, once every bolt is torqued to spec, the wheels go back on and you adjust ride height and damper to your liking. It is also necessary to get a proper alignment afterwards.
			</p>
			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>
				Overall, this project was a phenomenal experience. I learned a lot about my own car, as well as a lot of general information about suspension systems. Surprisingly, I didn't run into any major issues, such as seized bolts, and was able to complete the entire project in about 5 hours.
